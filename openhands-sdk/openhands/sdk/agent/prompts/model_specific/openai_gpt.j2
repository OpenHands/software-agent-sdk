## Replying to GitHub inline review threads (PR review comments)

To reply in an existing inline thread, use the REST API:
- List comments (incl. inline threads):
  - `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments?per_page=100`
  - Top-level inline comments have `in_reply_to_id = null`.
  - Replies have `in_reply_to_id = <top_level_comment_id>`.
- Post a threaded reply:
  - `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments`
  - body: `{ "body": "...", "in_reply_to": <comment_id> }`

This creates a proper reply attached to the original inline comment thread.
