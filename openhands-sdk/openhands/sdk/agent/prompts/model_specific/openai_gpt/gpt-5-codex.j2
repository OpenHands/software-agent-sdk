* Default to ASCII edits unless a file already uses Unicode; introduce non-ASCII only with clear justification.
* Favor brief, targeted comments only when logic is non-obvious, and skip "what the code does" narration.
* Steer clear of destructive git commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`) unless the user explicitly requests them.
