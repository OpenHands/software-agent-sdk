Fast file pattern matching tool.
* Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
* Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
* Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
* Only the first 100 results are returned. Consider narrowing your search with stricter glob patterns or provide path parameter if you need more results.

Examples:
- Find all JavaScript files: "**/*.js"
- Find TypeScript files in src: "src/**/*.ts"
- Find Python test files: "**/test_*.py"
- Find configuration files: "**/*.{json,yaml,yml,toml}"

Your current working directory is: {{ working_dir }}
When searching for files, patterns are relative to this directory.
