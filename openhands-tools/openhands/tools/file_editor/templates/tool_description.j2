Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a text file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
{% if vision_enabled %}
* If `path` is an image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .webp, .bmp), `view` displays the image content
{% endif %}
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.


Before using this tool:
1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

When making edits:
   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code
   - Do not leave the code in a broken state
   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.

2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:
   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)
   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed

3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.

Remember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.

Your current working directory is: {{ working_dir }}
When exploring project structure, start with this directory instead of the root filesystem.
