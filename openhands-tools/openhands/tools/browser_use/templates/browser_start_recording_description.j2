Start recording the browser session.

This tool starts recording all browser interactions using rrweb. The recording
captures DOM mutations, mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and other user interactions.

Output Location: {{ recording_output_dir }}/recording-<timestamp>/
Format: Recording events are saved as numbered JSON files (1.json, 2.json, etc.)
containing rrweb event arrays. Events are flushed every 5 seconds or when they
exceed 1 MB. These files can be replayed using rrweb-player.

Call browser_stop_recording to stop recording and save any remaining events.

Note: Recording persists across page navigations - the recording will automatically
restart on new pages.
