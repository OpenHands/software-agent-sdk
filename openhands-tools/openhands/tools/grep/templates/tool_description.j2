Fast content search tool.
* Searches file contents using regular expressions
* Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+", etc.)
* Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
* Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time.
* Only the first 100 results are returned. Consider narrowing your search with stricter regex patterns or provide path parameter if you need more results.
* Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns.
