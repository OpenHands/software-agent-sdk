Lists the contents of a specified directory.

Returns detailed information about each file and subdirectory, including:
- Name and path
- Whether it's a file or directory
- File size (in bytes)
- Last modified timestamp

By default, lists only the immediate contents of the directory. Use `recursive=True`
to list subdirectories up to 2 levels deep.

Hidden files (starting with .) are included in the listing.

Examples:
- List current directory: list_directory()
- List specific directory: list_directory(dir_path="/path/to/dir")
- List recursively: list_directory(dir_path="/path/to/dir", recursive=True)

Your current working directory is: {{ working_dir }}
Relative paths will be resolved from this directory.
