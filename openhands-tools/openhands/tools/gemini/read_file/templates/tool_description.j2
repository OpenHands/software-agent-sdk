Reads and returns the content of a specified file.

If the file is large, the content will be truncated. The tool's response will
clearly indicate if truncation has occurred and will provide details on how to
read more of the file using the 'offset' and 'limit' parameters.

For text files, it can read specific line ranges.

Examples:
- Read entire file: read_file(file_path="/path/to/file.py")
- Read with pagination: read_file(file_path="/path/to/file.py", offset=100, limit=50)

Your current working directory is: {{ working_dir }}
File paths can be absolute or relative to this directory.
