Replaces text within a file.

By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences
when `expected_replacements` is specified. The edit will fail if the actual
number of occurrences doesn't match the expected count.

This tool is useful for making targeted changes to files without rewriting
the entire content.

Key behaviors:
- To create a new file: use an empty string for `old_string`
- The `old_string` must match EXACTLY (including whitespace and indentation)
- If 0 occurrences are found, the edit fails with an error
- If the number of occurrences doesn't match `expected_replacements`, the edit fails
- If `old_string` equals `new_string`, no changes are made

Tips for success:
- Include enough context (3-5 lines) to make `old_string` unique
- Use the `read_file` tool first to verify the exact text to replace
- For large changes affecting many lines, consider `write_file` instead

Examples:
- Simple replacement: edit(file_path="test.py", old_string="old text", new_string="new text")
- Create file: edit(file_path="new.py", old_string="", new_string="print('hello')")
- Multiple replacements: edit(file_path="test.py", old_string="foo", new_string="bar", expected_replacements=3)
