Writes content to a specified file in the local filesystem.

This tool overwrites the entire content of the file. If the file doesn't exist,
it will be created. If it exists, all previous content will be replaced.

This is useful for:
- Creating new files
- Completely rewriting files when many changes are needed
- Setting initial file content

For smaller edits to existing files, consider using the 'edit' tool instead,
which allows targeted find/replace operations.

Examples:
- Create new file: write_file(file_path="/path/to/new.py", content="print('hello')")
- Overwrite file: write_file(file_path="/path/to/existing.py", content="new content")

Your current working directory is: {{ working_dir }}
File paths can be absolute or relative to this directory.
